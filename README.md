# Mixed Messages

## Codecademy project details
+ This project should use JavaScript to produce a truly random message composed of at least 3 different sections.

## My take
+ This project will be an astrology prediction simulator.

+ It will produce a random:
  + Astrology sign
  + Planet's moon
  + Generic prediction / advice
