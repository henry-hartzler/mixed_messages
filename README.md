# Mixed Messages

## Project details
+ This project should use JavaScript to produce a truly random message composed of at least 3 different sections.

## My take
+ This project will be an astrology prediction simulator.

+ It will produce a random:
  + Astrology sign
  + Planet's moon
  + Generic prediction / advice

## Final product
Discover your daily horoscope based on your astrology sign, the orientation of the planets, and their moons. A word of caution, these predictions may be mixed up due to random indexes sorting through Javascript arrays!
